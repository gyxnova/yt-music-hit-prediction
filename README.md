# yt-music-hit-prediction
My Second Kaggle ML project predicting yt-music-hit-prediction using Python.

# 🎧 YouTube Music Hit Prediction

## 📘 About
This project predicts whether a YouTube music video will become a “hit” based on its metadata (views, likes, and comments).

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Logistic Regression
- PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model Evaluation

## 📈 Accuracy
Achieved **95% accuracy** — experimenting with PCA for further improvement.

## 🛠️ Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 🌍 Project Type
Self-created dataset + ML experiment inspired by Kaggle-style workflow.
